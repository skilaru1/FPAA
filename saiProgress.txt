Edited compileAndProgram method to include a parameter for driver object
- Seems unnecessary because driver is a public instance variable in the superclass of OscopeView, but method didnâ€™t recognize it

- programData within the driver class is throwing a ReadTimeOutException, not sure why yet
	- Something to do with threads and AsyncTask is causing error
	- First line of programData is int cpu_stat_check = Utils.toInt(readRegister("CPU_STAT")); -> calls ReadRegister -> calls read(int length) ->  calls read(int length, int n_millis) -> where error is occurring
	 
	- Figure out how threads work in Java to be able to solve this error
