Edited compileAndProgram method to include a parameter for driver object
- Seems unnecessary because driver is a public instance variable in the superclass of OscopeView, but method didnâ€™t recognize it

- programData within the driver class is throwing a ReadTimeOutException, not sure why yet
	- Something to do with threads and AsyncTask is causing error
	- First line of programData is int cpu_stat_check = Utils.toInt(readRegister("CPU_STAT")); -> calls ReadRegister -> calls read(int length) ->  calls read(int length, int n_millis) -> ReadThread AsyncTask ->where error is occurring
	 
	- Figure out how threads work in Java to be able to solve this error

	- Not sure what the cpu_stat_check is supposed to be doing or checking. The code might be unaffected by removing that line and programming the FPAA anyway.
	- From what I can tell, it just reads a bunch of useless data from the FPAA to test if it's connected, but we already check for connection way before we call this function.
